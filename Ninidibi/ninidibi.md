# [S4CTF 2021](https://s4ctf.peykar.io):ninidibi

**Category:** miscellaneous

**Description:** let's shuffle it!

We are given a file called `ninidibi` 

## solution overview

We don't know what the file type is so let's run this command:
```bash
file ninidibi
```
and the result is:
```bash
ninidibi: data
```
hmmm not useful though:(

Ok let's try [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) maybe it can help us:

```bash 
binwalk ninidibi
```

the result is:
```bash
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Nothing!

at this point we can guess there is something wrong with the file signature so let's just see the binary data:
```bash
hexdump -C ninidibi
```
And the result:
```bash

...
```
You can see first lines of the file content. at first glance you can guess this is related to a DB file(although the file name speak for itself:) 
because of that `CREATE TABLE ...` line. considering the file size we can guess this file is a SQLite database file. so let's check it out.

SQLite file signature:
```text
hex: 53 51 4C 69 74 65 20 66 6F 72 6D 61 74 20 33 00           Sizet:    16 Bytes
ASCII: SQLite format 3                                         Offset:  0 Bytes	
â€¢	
```

Yeah we guessed right as you can see the first 6 bytes is missing in file signature so let's just fix it and run the `file` command again:

```bash
ninidibi: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3031001

```
Ok let's open it with `sqlite3` command and see how many tables we have:

as you can see we have 2 tables here `flag` and `orders` let's see the table contents:
