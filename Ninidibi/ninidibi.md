# [S4CTF 2021](https://s4ctf.peykar.io):ninidibi

**Category:** miscellaneous

**Description:** let's shuffle it!

We are given a file called `ninidibi` 

## solution overview

We don't know what the file type is so let's run this command:
```bash
file ninidibi
```
and the result is:
```bash
ninidibi: data
```
hmmm not useful though:(

Ok let's try [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) maybe it can help us:

```bash 
binwalk ninidibi
```

the result is:
```bash
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Nothing!

at this point we can guess there is something wrong with the file signature so let's just see the binary data:
```bash
hexdump -C ninidibi
```
And the result:
```bash

```
this is the first lines of the file content. at first glance you can guess this is related to a DB file because of that `CREATE TABLE ...` line(although the file name speak for itself:)). considering the file size we can guess this file is a SQLite database file. so let's check it out.

SQLite file signature:
```text
hex: 53 51 4C 69 74 65 20 66 6F 72 6D 61 74 20 33 00           Sizet:    16 Bytes
ASCII: SQLite format 3                                         Offset:  0 Bytes	
â€¢	
```

Yeah we guessed right as you can see the first 6 bytes is missing in file signature so let's just fix it and run the `file` command again:

```bash
ninidibi: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3031001

```
Ok let's open it with `sqlite3` command:

![tablesList](table_list.png)

as you can see we have 2 tables here `flag` and `orders` let's see the table contents:

![tableContents](table_contents.png)

at first sight it is obvious that the flag table contains some ascii codes but we don't know yet what contents of orders table mean so let's just convert those ascii codes to string:

![strings](string.png)

Ok the flag characters is shuffled. so how do we rearrenge them again? this is where orders table comes into play. the orders table contains `53` numbers (the flag length - 1 we'll see why soon) which shows the actuall place of each character in flag table. for ex. character `4` belongs to 12th position, `_` belongs to 11th position and so on.

but there is one gotcha here. let's sort content of orders table:

![ordered](order_place.png)

As you can see we have some numbers between `0` and `53`. but the number `7` and `10` is missing and number `13` is repeated twice. so how are we supposed to know which positions these three numbers belong? to know this let's just rearrange the characters by that incomplete order using the script below.

```python
 
flag = '4 _ _ U 7 0 a ! M S 0 n r } a S i a R C 5 C B Y K f b _ 4 l R 3 W h ! F b h f _ _ _ _ _ P _ l { _ A b T ! s'
places = '12 11 38 25 31 7 48 51 37 21 14 17 15 53 35 0 19 43 32 2 18 20 6 9 28 30 8 23 1 42 36 16 34 44 50 4 46 49 13 13 22 40 29 45 39 33 47 5 24 26 41 3 52 27'

flag = flag.split(' ')
places = places.split(' ')

for i in range(54):
    if(str(i) in places):
        print(flag[places.index(str(i))])

```
and the result is:

```text
a_Rb!lCfB_4hSnR0CS5M_b{U_!Y_K7aP3}l!___A4iW_F_0bhaTr
```
hmm that was predictable :|

## so how this is gonna help us?

in those two arrays Look at the character which belongs to position `0` yeah it's `a`. now look at the character placed right next to the `a` it is `S` so as you might guess there is one tiny gap here. one of the missing numbers must be placed right before the `0` in places array. at this point you can do the trial and error approach btw let's just place `7` number at position 0 of places array. the result of the script is:
```text
S4CTF{B4bY__f0r3n5iCS___7AsK_f0R_WaRMUP_blah_blah!!!}
```
Lucky us! but what about `10`? look at the characters at index `38` and `39` of flag array i mean `f` and `_` which of these characters belong to position `10` of the flag? i hope you guessed right yeah `_` (if you look at the flag three `_` are following each other right?). finally by fixing this position and running the script above again:

## Flag
the flag is:`S4CTF{B4bY___f0r3n5iCS___7AsK_f0R_WaRMUP_blah_blah!!!}`
